Lorenzo Simone received his MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Pisa with a final summa cum laude grade. The thesis under the title "*Deep generative models for electrocardiography time series*" was supervised by [Prof. Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/). The main objective of the research has been synthesizing conditioned ECG data agreeing
with a standard of morphological plausibility. We proposed a semi-supervised generative adversarial approach (ECGAN) capable of conditioning the generative probability distribution with respect to: normal rhythm and premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).
